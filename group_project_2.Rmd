```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Load all the csv files
Country <- read.csv("~/working/data_science_folders/data_munging_EDA/group_project_2_munging/world-development-indicators/Country.csv")

CountryNotes <- read.csv("~/working/data_science_folders/data_munging_EDA/group_project_2_munging/world-development-indicators/CountryNotes.csv")

Footnotes <- read.csv("~/working/data_science_folders/data_munging_EDA/group_project_2_munging/world-development-indicators/Footnotes.csv")

Indicators <- read.csv("~/working/data_science_folders/data_munging_EDA/group_project_2_munging/world-development-indicators/Indicators.csv")

Series <- read.csv("~/working/data_science_folders/data_munging_EDA/group_project_2_munging/world-development-indicators/Series.csv", comment.char="#")

SeriesNotes <- read.csv("~/working/data_science_folders/data_munging_EDA/group_project_2_munging/world-development-indicators/SeriesNotes.csv")
```

Now that all our data is loaded in, the next step would be to list all of the different indicators present in this dataset.

```{r}
#Load in the needed packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

#Get the counts
counts <- Indicators %>%
  group_by(IndicatorCode, IndicatorName) %>%
  summarise(NumCountries = n_distinct(CountryName),
            NumYears     = n_distinct(Year),
            FirstYear    = min(Year),
            LastYear     = max(Year))

counts$IndicatorName <- gsub("\\$", "dollar", counts$IndicatorName)
View(counts)
```
